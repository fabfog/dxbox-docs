The `use-less-react` logo is more than just a random graphic element; it is a visual representation of the philosophy of this library.

### A Conceptual Tribute

The logo was designed to subtly yet effectively communicate our core value proposition: **"The power of React, with less complexity."**

1.  **Hexagonal Architecture:**
    The primary outline is a well-defined hexagonal shape. This is a direct nod to the **Hexagonal Architecture**, the concept that primarily inspired `use-less-react`.

2.  **The React Logo:**
    The logo's shape is conceptually designed to be inscribable within the original React logo. This establishes a visual connection, communicating that our library fits React, but trims the excess away.

3.  **The "Minus" Symbol at the Center (The "Less"):**
    The central glyph, a circle bisected by a horizontal line, carries a dual meaning:
    * It references the **heart of the state** (the central circle in the React logo).
    * The cutting line is a **"minus"** in negative space.


### Less is More

The design of the logo is an **affirmation of simplicity**: `use-less-react` removes the complications imposed by a contaminated MVVM architecture in favor of a cleaner, more consistent and flexible approach. 

You achieve **more expressive power** with less code, less dependencies, and less architectural friction.

I also like to think it resembles the head of a **bolt**: simple, practical, no-nonsense, and indispensable for holding your architecture together!
